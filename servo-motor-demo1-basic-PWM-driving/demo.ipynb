    "# Motivation\n",

    "- you want to provide a driving force to a pendulum\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "An inexpensive RC servo motor is an easy way to accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Bill Earl (ref. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/rc-servos)\n",
    "> The most common and economical type of servo motor in the hobbyist world is the RC Servo. These were originally designed for hobbyist Radio Control systems. But these days they are widely used for all sorts of small-scale projects where moderately precise positioning is required. Most RC servos provide position control over an approximately 180 degree \n",
    "range. They do not provide speed control or continuous rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal for driving a servo to a particular angle (and holding it there) is fairly simple.  According to Simon Monk (ref. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors)\n",
    "> The position of the servo motor is set by the length of a pulse. The servo expects to receive a pulse roughly every 20 milliseconds \\[*equivalent to a PWM frequency of 50Hz*\\]. If that pulse is high for 1 millisecond, then the servo angle will be zero, if it is 1.5 milliseconds, then it will be at its centre position and if it is 2 milliseconds it will be at 180 degrees. The end points of the servo can vary and many servos only turn through about 170 degrees.\n"
